# Starbucks-clone

This is the clone of Starbucks Website that I created in December.
I have used HTML,CSS and Bootstrap in the project and looking forward to use Javascript as well.
The whole website is complete though there are a few issues that need to be resolved like Navbar and a few small changes.
The website is a clone earlier UI/UX of **Starbucks**, current website of Starbucks is completly different.
